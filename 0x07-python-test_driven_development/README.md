0x07. Python - Test-driven development

In this project, I started practicing test-driven development using `docstring`
and `unittest` in Python.


Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
Python Test Cases
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files should end with a new line
All your test files should be inside a folder tests
All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)')
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)


Write a function that adds 2 integers.

Prototype: def add_integer(a, b=98):
a and b must be integers or floats, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message a must be an integer or b must be an integer
a and b must be first casted to integers if they are float
Returns an integer: the addition of a and b
You are not allowed to import any module


Write a function that divides all elements of a matrix.

Prototype: def matrix_divided(matrix, div):
matrix must be a list of lists of integers or floats, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
Each row of the matrix must be of the same size, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message Each row of the matrix must have the same size
div must be a number (integer or float), otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message div must be a number
div can’t be equal to 0, otherwise raise a ZeroDivisionError exception with the message division by zero
All elements of the matrix should be divided by div, rounded to 2 decimal places
Returns a new matrix
You are not allowed to import any module

Write a function that prints My name is <first name> <last name>

Prototype: def say_my_name(first_name, last_name=""):
first_name and last_name must be strings otherwise, raise a TypeError exception with the message first_name must be a string or last_name must be a string

Write a function that prints a square with the character #.

Prototype: def print_square(size):
size is the size length of the square
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
if size is a float and is less than 0, raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
